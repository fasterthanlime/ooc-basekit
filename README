Amos Wenger's ooc bindings for Steve Dekorte's libbasekit

basekit provides a common ground for high level language implementation.
it contains a reasonable implementation of collections,
sequences (UTF-8, UCS-2/UCS-4 string handling), and portable versions of
often-used system functions.

Instructions
============

You must checkout Steve Dekorte's basekit in the same directory as ooc-basekit
in order to use it.
Then add it to your sourcepath, e.g. compile with

ooc -sourcepath=.:../ooc-basekit/ myTest.ooc

(if your project's folder is in the same folder as ooc-basekit)
